# multi-cloud-aws-gcp--terraform-deployment
This project demonstrates the process and best practices of deploying a container application in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) and Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform and multi-cloud architecture.

### The project includes the following steps:

Create a Terraform configuration file that defines the infrastructure resources required to deploy the application.
Use Terraform to plan and apply the infrastructure changes.
Deploy the application container image to the target cloud providers.
Configure the application to connect to the underlying infrastructure.
Test the application to verify that it is deployed and running correctly.
The project also includes a README file that provides instructions on how to set up and use the project.

This project is intended to be a starting point for deploying container applications in a multi-cloud environment. It can be used as a reference for learning how to use Terraform and multi-cloud architecture, or it can be customized to deploy specific applications.
